# k-means
Workflow:
Load & preprocess data – select numeric features and scale them.
Dimensionality reduction (PCA) – optional, used for 2D visualization.
Elbow Method & Silhouette Score – determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
K-Means clustering – assign customers to clusters.
Visualization – plot clusters in 2D space using PCA.
Evaluation – measure cluster quality using Silhouette Score and analyze cluster profiles.

Outcome:
The model groups customers into distinct segments, which can be used for targeted marketing strategies and customer behavior analysis.
